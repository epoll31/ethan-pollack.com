            <h2>$Path</h2>
            <p>
                '$PATH' is essentially a list of paths that your terminal 
                session can search through to shorten common used paths. 
            </p>
            <h4>Viewing your $PATH</h4>
            <p> 
                Run the command 'echo $PATH' in your terminal. This will 
                return the list of paths. They will be separated by a space, 
                colon, etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Adding to $PATH</h4>
            <p>
                What you will need: the full command path and the shorthand
                command name. Let's call these '/full/path' and 'name', respectively.
                
                Run the command 'sudo sh -c 'echo "/full/path" >> /etc/paths.d/name'
            </p>
            <h4>Running a command</h4>
            <p> 
                Running a command is as simple as writing the command name 
                followed by any parameters that are required. If the command
                is not in your $PATH then you must specify the full path name 
                of a command.
            </p>

            <h4>echo</h4>
            <p>
                Run the command 'echo text' in your terminal. This will repeat
                any input as an output.
            </p>
            <h4>which</h4>
            <p>
                Run the command 'which (insert command)' in your terminal. This
                will display the path of the specified command. 
            </p>
            <h4>whoami</h4>
            <p>
                Run the command 'whoami' in your terminal. This will display 
                the username of the current user.
